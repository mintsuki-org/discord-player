 discord-player
================

discord-player is a "client" (really, it's just a web browser) meant for Discord.

 Why?
======

Because the official client is proprietary and slow for me, and it does stuff in the
background that hogs my machine :(
I'd use Discord in my browser of choice, but it doesn't run correctly.

 Build dependencies
====================

 -- Debian and Ubuntu --

On Debian and Ubuntu, discord-player depends on the following packages:

    build-essential qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev qt5-default qtwebengine5-dev

 -- Arch --

On Arch, it depends on qt5, which can be installed with:

    sudo pacman -S qt5

Then install all selections.

 How to build
==============

To configure the package, use the ./configure script:

    ./configure

Or, if you want to specify a custom prefix:

    ./configure --prefix=/my/custom/path

To build, just run:

    make

To install it run:

    make install

(or 'sudo make install' if you need admin privileges)


That is it, have fun! ;)

P.S.: I cannot write C++
